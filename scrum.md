# October 2nd, 2020

### ----- ACCOMPLISHED -----

        FELL SHORT of completing Starter cards (A) to my satisfaction.

        CREATED Login, Register, Home and Nav system for Starter Cards (A).
        Incorporated Sweet Alerts and Toastr, stubbed in examples for their use.
        Separated and stubbed out services for coming end points and future pages.

        FIXED SELF INDUCED BUGS
        (stumbled on some crazy self-induced bugs by starting entire project from scratch and not using sabio starter template)

        HACKED AWAY AT BOOTSTRAP and CSS for NAV and Forms.
        (spent too much time trying to make it look as bad as it currently does)

        COMPLETELY REFACTORED my custom Teams entities assignment, realized it wasn't necessary for this one,
        then refactored again, but lessons learned help build my growing services structure and drive home the
        idea of bubbling up catch cases within services.

### ----- WILL ACCOMPLISH -----

        Finalize (A)  (MINIMAL TASKS REMAIN - mostly just validating what I already have.)

        Move on to (B) and get the Friends (peopleView) working.

    Reviewed/Watched the mapping/filtering videos.

    Created new 'starter' project building from previous entities assignment.

    Started mandatory steps on my custom copy of the C93 Starter Board.
    (read wiki help api postman documentation, saved postman collection, etc)
    (made it up to Register, Login, Home Page in Section A)

    Separated/created services files for each proposed entities ahead.

### ----- WILL ACCOMPLISH -----

I will finish the START (A) mandatory board and start work on (B)

As Kanye West said:

I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.

```javascript
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if (arg) {
    $.facebox({ div: "#foo" });
  }
}
```

    function fancyAlert(arg) {
      if(arg) {
        $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
      }
    }
