### ----- BLOCKERS -----

        I'm on track, no blockers anticipated.  I'm learning how to keep focused, not get bogged down in a loop of unproductivity.

# October 2nd, 2020

### ----- ACCOMPLISHED -----

        FELL SHORT of completing Starter cards (A) to my satisfaction.

        CREATED Login, Register, Home and Nav system for Starter Cards (A).
        Incorporated Sweet Alerts and Toastr, stubbed in examples for their use.
        Separated and stubbed out services for coming end points and future pages.

        FIXED SELF INDUCED BUGS
        (stumbled on some crazy self-induced bugs by starting entire project from scratch and not using sabio starter template)

        HACKED AWAY AT BOOTSTRAP and CSS for NAV and Forms.
        (spent too much time trying to make it look as bad as it currently does)

        COMPLETELY REFACTORED my custom Teams entities assignment, realized it wasn't necessary for this one,
        then refactored again, but lessons learned help build my growing services structure and drive home the
        idea of bubbling up catch cases within services.

### ----- WILL ACCOMPLISH -----

        Finalize (A)  (MINIMAL TASKS REMAIN - mostly just validating what I already have.)

        Move on to (B) and get the Friends (peopleView) working.

### ----- BLOCKERS -----

        Failing to focus on the task at hand and working towards future tasks/optimization can be a show-stopper for me.

        mapping/filtering (sports, presidents, cakes)

    Watched the Intro Topics Video.

    Created new 'starter' project building from previous entities assignment.

    Started mandatory steps on my custom copy of the C93 Starter Board.
    (read wiki help api postman documentation, saved postman collection, etc)
    (made it up to Register, Login, Home Page in Section A)

    Separated/created services files for each proposed entities ahead.

### ----- WILL ACCOMPLISH -----

Meticulous and Slow paced learning of new concepts - focusing on quality code.
